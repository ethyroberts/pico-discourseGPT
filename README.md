# DiscourseGPT
A short demo using a letter-based GPT model trained on South African hate speech data. The model is trained in the same way as Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT, though generates data of the form of SA discourse. 

Feel free to contact me should you like access to the private repo that houses the data used here :)
